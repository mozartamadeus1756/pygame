# pygames !!! 

ive made a lot of diffrenet pygames and eazy tutorials on how ot make and play them yeyy



## guessing game !! 
the purpose of this game is to guess waht number the randomiser has chosen. in the code i also set a limit of guesses, so you cant forever, and it makes the game a bit easier !! so lets go thru how i made it:

in this code im using an import aka a libary, and so i place that at the top of the code:

```python
import random
```

secondly you start with a introduction, so the user unserstand whats about to happen: 

```python
print("this is the number guessing game !!") # and so on ...
```
